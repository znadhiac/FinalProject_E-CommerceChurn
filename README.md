# E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION
This group final project presents a machine learningâ€“based churn prediction model for an e-commerce platform, using features from five behavioral domains: demographics, engagement, transactions, platform preference, and satisfaction. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and class imbalance handling, the project uncovers patterns behind customer disengagement and identifies high-risk customers. The resulting insights enable earlier churn detection, data-driven decisions, better retention planning, and more efficient marketing spend.
